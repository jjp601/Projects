# Movie Trailer Website Project

The project is simply a website that displays all of my my favorite movies.

## Getting Started

In order to checkout the website with all my favorite movies you will need to run the 'entertainment_center.py' file in your terminal. When you run this file it will dynamically render the website in the browser. You can the see all of my favorite movies and you can select any of the movies on the webpage to see the trailer of the movie yourself.
